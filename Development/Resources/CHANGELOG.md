# ChangeLog

v2.0.5 4/3/2024 Fixed so works on macOS.  Fixed so works in Swift Playgrounds (had to bring minimum iOS level up to 15.2).  Renamed projects in Package.swift to fix so previews load consistently in Swift Playgrounds and Xcode previews.
v2.0.4 4/2/2024 Renamed project from DeviceTest to Device.  Fixed so supported on tvOS 14.  Added crash detection to newest Apple Watch models.  Backed minimum iOS version to iOS 14.  Changed watchOS minimum to 6.  Updated minimum deployment targets in README.  Added fallbacks for some iOS 15+ only features.
v2.0.3 4/2/2024 Made screen size resolution width and height public.  Removed HardwareListView from Hardware.swift to prevent issues with integrations.
v2.0.2 3/31/2024 Fixed so can run test app on iOS 15/16.  Added custom symbols for nicer UI and to make sure icons work on older iOS devices.  Added NFC, ApplePay, Barometer, and Ringer Switch to iPhones where missing.  Improved the display of the test view.
v2.0.1 3/31/2024 Fixed version warning with String.split() not available on iOS < 16.  Improved package definition with annotations.  Added public initializers for Device views.  Fixed compatibility and buildling for iOS < 16 in test views.  Updated Readme to highlight the new syntax.
v2.0.0 3/27/2024 Re-worked so there are capabilities rather than fixed parameters to make it easier to add features going forward.  Also created Migration code to convert old-format definitions into the new ones (allowing us to easily add definitions from other lists like older Macs).  Removed idiomProperties in favor of consistent capabilities.  Made Placard view apply stroke after fill so that it looks better.  Made supportId optional in most definitions to make it easier to address missing values.  Created function for reducing resolution into a ratio.  Reverted screenRatio legacy function to match DeviceKit implementation.  Added .air model tag.  Added MaterialColors to preserve color model information and allow coloring devices.  Made all hardware hashable so that Device could be Hashable for easy use in ForEach functions.  Added mac devices from https://github.com/voyager-software/MacLookup/blob/master/Sources/MacLookup/Resources/all-macs.json (thank you!).  Added symbol names for capabilities.  Added DeviceInfoView for testing and presentation.
v1.1.2 3/21/2024 Fixed problem where rounded display corners was left in the vision definition.  Preparing for re-write of the capabilities engine.
v1.1.1 3/20/2024 Fixed so readme icon works again due to moved assets to Resources folder.  Added isApplePencilCapable flag for iPads.  Removed legacy unused screen attributes (should add those back in under capabilities once we switch models in v2).
v1.1.0 3/20/2024 Added symbols for device idiom icons and various build modes.  Fixed TestView Any to String conversion issue.  Added dynamicIsland configuration parameter.  Added in missing iPhone 14 Pro Max and updated several screen sizes and some wrong support IDs.  Added isMini flag for HomePods.  Added Mac forms. Created test for (Designed for iPad) mode vs native mode.  Added XCode test project so that we can build on visionOS and tvOS and watchOS and various mac targets.  visionOS (Designed for iPad) properly reports the new isDesignedForiPad flag when using a compatibility app.  Added scroll view so visible on watchOS or in iPhone landscape.  Added tvOS, visionOS, macOS, and watchOS icons.
v1.0.11 3/11/2024 Fixed BatteryView to make sure it updates when DeviceBattery updates.  Fixed so macOS reports charging instead of full when charging.
v1.0.10 3/11/2024 Updated documentation.  Changed phone test color to red since gray is not very obvious.  Re-worked BatteryView so that it can be scaled.
v1.0.9 3/11/2024 Fixed so that BatteryView actually uses the initialization parameters (formerly, would not because they were marked @State).
v1.0.8 3/9/2024 Updated Battery to be protocol instead of just a class so that it can be Mocked.  Added Mocks.  Added BatteryView for displaying battery indicator.
v1.0.7 3/9/2024 Removed accidentally left in debugging code.
v1.0.6 3/8/2024 Replaced checks for OSes with canImport(UIKit).  Added some code so battery level works on macOS Catalyst.  Updated readme to indicate macOS support.  Updated Description of Current Device.  Fixed so identifier works correctly in macCatalyst.
v1.0.5 3/8/2024 Fixed so name that appears in Package List is Device not DeviceTestApp.
v1.0.4 3/8/2024 Fixed so UIDevice is available on visionOS (UIKit wasn't being included on that platform.)
v1.0.3 3/8/2024 Tested for compatibility.  Updated Readme.  Fixed so previews work.  Added Test code.
v1.0.2 3/5/2024 Re-worked so Disk functions are available even before iOS 11 by moving availability checks into functions.
v1.0.1 2/28/2024 Heath's additions and re-working code for IdiomType so that we can subclass and have device initializers while still being value types.
v1.0.0 2/16/2024 Initial Project based off of DeviceKit but designed to be more maintainable and compatible.

## Bugs to fix:
Known issues that need to be addressed.

[ ] Designed for iPad running on macOS has all appearance of being an actual iPad and battery level does not work.  Need help on this edge case (or use macCatalyst or macOS development).  Running on macOS (Designed for iPad) reports OS as iPadOS and returns an iPad Pro identifier instead of a Mac identifier and battery information is incorrect.
[ ] Make so low power mode colors yellow when not red for system icon.  For colorful version, have low power mode color the outline in yellow.
[ ] Need help getting identifier when buildling for macOS (not catalyst)
[ ] Building from Playground (not using Xcode project), Designed for iPad doesn't report properly but identifier is correct (systemName reports iPadOS) - same when buildling for Mac Catalyst.  Buildling from the Xcode project Designed for iPad does propertly report isDesignedForiPad but the battery indicator and device is wrong.  Buildling for Mac Catalyst does propertly report device and battery.

## Roadmap:
Planned features and anticipated API changes.  If you want to contribute, this is a great place to start.

[ ] Add support IDs for macs and anything that has one missing.
[ ] Double check and update all device color sets. (right click on the color swatches and inspect element for the hex code)  https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-13-mini,iphone-13,iphone-15-pro
[ ] Add weight option for battery text/symbol (title originally was bold and now that we're doing font size, add weight parameter)
[ ] Add new devices (ongoing).
[ ] Improve test app user interface/layout.
[ ] Add tests to complete code coverage.
[ ] Create tests in such a way that they can be run in Previews and in the example App (may require a project dependency).
[ ] See if there's a way to automate tests on various platform combinations.
[ ] Support landscape on iPhone for test view and use size classes to re-layout.
[ ] For devices that support multiple orientations, automatically apply current orientation to the symbol name for current device.
[ ] Create replacement for rounded display corners since faceID is a good proxy but misses modern touchID power button iPads.  Have as capability.

## Proposals:
This is where proposals can be discussed for potential movement to the roadmap.

[ ] Change Battery from Protocol to the DeviceBattery code and have MockBattery be a subclass that overrides functions?
[ ] Add release date?
[ ] Create better way of scaling battery so that it can scale with dynamic type?
[ ] Add a way to check that privacy checks have been added when using APIs that need privacy permissions (have a configuration flag that needs to be set to ensure that privacy flags have been set).
[ ] Convert SF Symbol names to an enum to allow version checking?
[ ] If there's a way to fetch the actual model number (like MN572LL/A), then we can use this to give information of the state of the device (new, refurb, replaced, personalized, etc): https://osxdaily.com/2018/01/27/determine-iphone-new-refurbished-replaced/
[ ] Help contribute to DeviceKit suggest ordering consistently with identifier order?
[ ] Should forceTouch and touch3d be separated?
[ ] Add volume controls and power button and home button capabilities?  Possibly with rumored camera button?
