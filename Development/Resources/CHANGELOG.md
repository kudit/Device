v1.0.3 3/8/2024 Tested for compatibility.  Updated Readme.  Fixed so previews work.  Added Test code.
v1.0.2 3/5/2024 Re-worked so Disk functions are available even before iOS 11 by moving availability checks into functions.
v1.0.1 2/28/2024 Heath's additions and re-working code for IdiomType so that we can subclass and have device initializers while still being value types.
v1.0.0 2/16/2024 Initial Project based off of DeviceKit but designed to be more maintainable and compatible.
