- [x] Various device metrics (e.g. screen size, screen ratio, PPI)
- [x] Battery state
- [x] Battery level
- [x] Battery symbol
- [x] Battery color
- [x] Low Power Mode detection
- [x] Guided Access Session detection
- [x] Screen brightness
- [x] Display Zoom detection
- [x] Detect available sensors (Touch ID, Face ID, Optic ID)
- [x] Detect available disk space
- [x] Apple Pencil support detection
- [x] Images and support links

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- tvOS 11.0+
- watchOS 4.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Installation
Install by adding this as a package dependency to your code.  This can be done in XCode or Swift Playgrounds!

### Swift Package Manager

#### Swift 5
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/device/Device.git", from: "1.0.0"),
    /// ...
]
```

You can try these examples in a Swift Playground by adding package: https://github.com/kudit/Device

## Usage
First make sure to import the framework:
```swift
import Device
```

Here are some usage examples.

### Get the device You're Running On
```swift
let device = Device.current

print(device) // prints, for example, "iPhone 6 Plus"

if device.hasForce3dTouchSupport {
    // do something that needs force-touch.
} else {
    // fallback for devices that do not support this.
}
```

### Get the device idiom
```swift
let device = Device.current
if device.idiom == .pad {
  // iPad
} else if device.idiom == .phone {
  // iPhone
} else if device.vision {
  // Apple Vision device
}
```

### Check if running in a Simulator
```swift
if Device.current.isSimulator {
  // Running on one of the simulators
  // Skip doing something irrelevant for Simulator
} 
```

### Check if running in a Preview
```swift
if Device.current.isPreview {
  // Running in an XCode #Preview
} 
```

### Check if running in a Playground
```swift
if Device.current.isPlayground {
  // Running in an XCode #Preview
} 
```

### Check if running on a physical device
```swift
if Device.current.isRealDevice {
  // Running on physical hardware and not a simulator
} 
```

### Get the Current Battery State
**Note:**

> When getting the current battery state, battery monitoring enabled will be temporarily set to true and then restored to whatever it was beforehand, so no need to manage monitoring separately.  If you want to continuously monitor the battery state or level, you can add a monitor that will continuously call your code whenever the level changes.

```swift


if let battery = Device.current.battery {
    // do things that need the battery
    if battery.currentState == .full || (battery.currentState == .charging && battery.currentLevel >= 75) {
        print("Your battery is happy! üòä")
    }
    
    // get the current battery level
    if battery.currentLevel >= 50 {
        install_iOS()
    } else {
        showLowBatteryWarning()
    }

    // add monitor to do something whenever battery level changes (like updating UI)
    battery.addMonitor {
        localBatteryLevel = battery.currentLevel
        localBatteryState = battery.currentState
    }
} else {
    // handle behaviour on devices without a battery
}
```

### Get the Current Battery Level
```swift
if let level = Device.current.battery?.currentLevel, level >= 50 {
  install_iOS()
} else {
  showError()
}
```

### Get Low Power mode status
```swift
if battery.lowPowerMode {
  print("Low Power mode is enabled! üîã")
} else {
  print("Low Power mode is disabled! üòä")
}
```

### Check if a Guided Access session is currently active
```swift
if Device.current.isGuidedAccessSessionActive {
  print("Guided Access session is currently active")
} else {
  print("No Guided Access session is currently active")
}
```

### Get Screen Brightness
```swift
if Device.current.screenBrightness > 50 {
  print("Take care of your eyes!")
}
```

### Get Available Disk Space
```swift
if Device.current.volumeAvailableCapacityForOpportunisticUsage ?? 0 > Int64(1_000_000) {
  // download that nice-to-have huge file
}

if Device.current.volumeAvailableCapacityForImportantUsage ?? 0 > Int64(1_000) {
  // download that file you really need
}
```
